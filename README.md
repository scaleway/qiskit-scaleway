# Scaleway provider for Qiskit

**Qiskit Scaleway** is a Python package to run quantum circuits on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/) infrastructure, providing access to:
- [AQT](https://www.aqt.eu/) ion-trapped quantum computers
- [IQM](https://meetiqm.com/) superconducting quantum computers
- [Aer](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer) state vector and tensor network multi-GPU emulators
- [Qsim](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim) NISQ emulators

To run circuits over [Quandela](https://www.quandela.com/) backends provided by Scaleway, you must use [Perceval SDK](https://perceval.quandela.net/) through the [Scaleway provider](https://perceval.quandela.net/docs/providers.html).

More info on the [Quantum service web page](https://www.scaleway.com/en/quantum-as-a-service/).

## Installation

We encourage installing Scaleway provider via the pip tool (a Python package manager):

```bash
pip install qiskit-scaleway
```

## Getting started

To instantiate the ScalewayProvider, you need to have an access token and a project_id

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

provider = ScalewayProvider(
    project_id="<your-scaleway-project-id>",
    secret_key="<your-scaleway-secret-key>",
)
```

Alternatively, the Scaleway Provider can discover your access token from environment variables:

```
export QISKIT_SCALEWAY_PROJECT_ID="project_id"
export QISKIT_SCALEWAY_SECRET_KEY="token"
```

Then you can instantiate the provider without any arguments:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_scaleway import ScalewayProvider

provider = ScalewayProvider()
```

Now you can have access to the supported backends:


```python
# List all operational backends
backends = provider.backends(operational=True)
print(backends)

# List all backends with a minimum number of qbits
backends = provider.backends(min_num_qubits=35)
print(backends)

# Retrieve a backend by providing search criteria. The search must have a single match
backend = provider.get_backend("aer_simulation_h100") # Or any gate-based compatible QPU
```

Define a quantum circuit and run it

```python
# Define a quantum circuit that produces a 4-qubit GHZ state.
qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.cx(0, 2)
qc.cx(0, 3)
qc.measure_all()

## DO NOT USE TRANSPILATION
## Transpilation is done server side on QaaS service

# Create and send a job to a new QPU's session (or on an existing one)
result = backend.run(qc, method="statevector", shots=1000).result()

if result.success:
    print(result.get_counts())
else:
    print(result.to_dict()["error"])

```
